Present the following kata to the paritcipants:

Shipping Cost Service

We are going to test drive a service for calculating the shipping cost of a package or letter.

- If the destination country is in the common market, a flat rate of 5 is calculated
- If the destination country is North America and the delivery type is
  - Express: a flat rate of 50 is calculated
  - Standard: a flat rate of 35 is calculated
- Any other country costs the km multiplied by 9% but a minimum of 15

Design with TDD the interface of another service to calculate the shipping costs. This service will use some REST call to retrieve the required information
