## Connections

Prepare either cards or a Miro board.

Instructions:

1. Read the terms on the board (cards) and arrange them into three categories. 
2. Describe the categories in a sentence

List of statements

| Category                             | Statements                 | 
|:-------------------------------------|:---------------------------|
| Noise                                | Layout and conventions     |
|                                      | Avoid unnecessary code     |
|                                      | Remove dead code           |
|                                      | Remove obvious comments    |
| Principle of least surprise (= POLS) | Names are not misleading   |
|                                      | Remove wrong comments      |
|                                      | Avoid mixing side-effects with business logic |
| Complexity                           | Dont implement clever code |
|                                      | Split long methods         |
|                                      | Names should describe the context and not the implementation |
|                                      | Avoid deep nesting levels  |
|                                      | Replace magic numbers with constants and enumerations |
|                                      | Handle conditional complexity |
|                                      | Avoid deep nesting levels  |
  
## Concepts

Present Slides: XP - Rules of Simple Design

3 Categories of Simplicity:  
 - Noise / POLS / Complexity


## Concrete Example

* Clean Code Repo Roland/Martin
    * Stage 5: Layout, Long method, Conditions, Duplication


## Conclusions

Note the rules you applied in this session and which you will apply in future.
